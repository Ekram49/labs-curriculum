# Module Inquiry 2

## Questions

1. What technical choices did you make today? 
* I decided to use an API from World Weather Organization which allows me to gather weather data of any cities in range of any given time.
* I decided to gather data of cities in the US which have population of more than 100,000. In this way I can keep the work load managable.
* I decided gather data at 24 hours of interval, starts at 09.01.2010 - 09.01.2020 in this way I can gather data of everyday for last 10 years
* I decided to use the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, total snow, humidity and precipitation data, since these are the most relevent data that people care about.
2. Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?
    - Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
    - Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.
    * I am happy with my choice of choosing API from World Weather Organization. This API allows me to get detailed accurate data of any place of any time. I am also happy with the data I decided to use since they seem most relevent.
    * Gathering data at 24 hours interval has some disadvantages, since one specific hour of data might not give an accurate picture of the whole day's weather condition. 
3. In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.
Collecting and managing data of more than 300 cities for every hour for last 10 years is not realistic. So I decided to stick with 24 hours interval
4. Extracting useful conclusions from your process: 
    - According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?
    I would consider a technical choice a good one when someone lay-outs all the options available, evaluates his options for advantages and disadvantages, also consider what choice is more valuable and makes sense and then chooses accordingly.
