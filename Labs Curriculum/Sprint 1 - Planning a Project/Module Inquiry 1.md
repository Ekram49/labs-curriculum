# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
* How many cities should we use?
* Should we use all the cities or major cities?
* What aspects of the cities should be our main focus?
* Should we create a user log in?
2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
* As a user, I can search for a city by name
* As a user, I can view the historical housing prices of a city.
* As a user, I can view the historical population of a city
* As a user, I can view the major job industries in a city
* As a user, I can view the historical weather data for a city
* As a user, I can compare multiple cities side-by-side

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
As a user, I can view the historical weather data for a city
Tasks to be completed:
* Create a wireframe for the weather display
* Create an API endpoint to respond to city ID with weather information
* Find an appropriate weather API to pull historical weather data
* Determine the "average"/"high"/"low" daily weather for each season (temp, humidity, precipitation)
* Gather data on extraordinary weather chance: Snow, Hurricanes, tornadoes, monsoon, floods, earthquakes, wildfires
* Create a line chart for summer high and winter low
* Create icons for things like disasters and snow
* Create temperature graphs - stacked histograph
* All above the features have been tested and deployed
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    We identified our tasks well. But had some difficulties describing user stories
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

I would have a clear description for each task, so that the stakeholder can have a clear idea about our plan
